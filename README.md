### Current Progress
Currently login/logout/registration and filtered searching of properties are implemented for the api. HTML and JS are only written
for login/logout, and a view of the home page with search/filter fields. The frontend interacts with the api for login/logout, but 
not for anything else as of right now.

### Building and running
To build and run, clone this repository and run with maven. To view website, go to localhost:8080 in browser.
